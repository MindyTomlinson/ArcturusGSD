			<p>Ester is a sweetheart; soft and gentle with her family and friends, but take her out to play and you can see that intelligence and trainability turn on. Great bone, great movement. We have high hopes for her.</p>

			<a href="layla.html"><h1>Layla</h1></a>
			<h3 class="regName">Arcturus' One and Only</h3>
			<p>Layla earned her name in an unusual way. I was supposed to go to an Eric Clapton concert that night, but Kaylee had other plans! Layla was the only girl born in the litter, so of course, she had to be named after Eric Clapton's song. She had to be tough to hold her own with eight brothers, but once she was out of the litter she became the sweetest girl we could ask for.</p>
			<p>Layla has a strong ability to track, just like her grandsire, Quando. Quando sired several Police and Search & Rescue dogs, so Layla is just following after her famous grandfather!</p>

			<a href="kaiya.html"><h1>Kaiya</h1></a>
			<h3 class="regName">Fein-Schild's Kaiya vom Arcturus</h3>
			<p> Kaiya is a Layla and Axle daughter. And just like her mother, Kaiya has quite a nose! She loves to show off her scenting ability with a game of "Find It", which she always wins.</p>
			<p>Kaiya is super intelligent, with that ball drive that makes a dog so easy to train. She's pleasent, easy to live with, and just wants to please and protect her family.</p>

			<a href="echo.html"><h1>Echo</h1></a>
			<h3 class="regName">Arcturus' Echo of the Night </h3>
			<p>Echo is just about perfect. A German-American cross, Echo has beautiful conformation, smooth, silky movement, and a temperament that is as sterling as her conformation. There are just not enough words to describe how beautiful this dog is inside and out.</p>
			<p>Echo is smart and so easily trained, with a nice balanced ball drive. She's gentle with children and puppies. I always let either Echo or <a href="layla.html">Layla</a> play with the puppies, since they are so patient and kind to them. This is a "heart" dog &mdash; I feel blessed to own her!</p>
			<p>Echo's hips and elbows have been OFA'd and she has been DNA-cleared of degenerative myelopathy (DM).</p>
