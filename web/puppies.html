			<h1>Echo's <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Louie's puppies are here!</h1>
			<p class="litter-desc justify">We are happy to announce an exciting litter out of our Echo and Kiefernfel's Louis Vuiton Armist. Three boys and four girls arrived April 4, and mom and puppies are all doing very well. We expect that these puppies will be healthy, pleasant-tempered family dogs with beautiful movement. Most are black and tans, but in a happy surprise, we also have two solid blacks, just like their mom!</p>
			<p class="litter-desc">Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

			<h2><a href="echo.html" alt="Echo's page">Echo</a></h2>
			<p class="justify">Echo is just about perfect. A German-American cross, Echo has beautiful conformation, smooth, silky movement, and a temperament that is as sterling as her conformation. There are just not enough words to describe how beautiful this dog is inside and out.</p>
			<p class="justify">Echo is smart and so easily trained, with a nice balanced ball drive. She's gentle with children and puppies. I always let either Echo or Layla play with the puppies, since they are so patient and kind to them. This is a "heart" dog â€” I feel blessed to own her!</p>
			<p class="justify last">Echo's hips and elbows have been OFA'd and she has been DNA-cleared of degenerative myelopathy.</p>

			<h2>Louie</a></h2>
			<p class="justify">Louie is an exceptional young male who has proven himself both here in the USA and Canada. Sweet-tempered and a loving family dog. Louie has OFA good hips and normal elbows, and has been DNA-cleared of degenerative myelopathy.</p>

				<h2><a href="kaiya.html">Kaiya</a></h2>
				<p class="justify">Kaiya is a Layla and Axle daughter. And just like her mother, Kaiya has quite a nose! She loves to show off her scenting ability with a game of "Find It", which she always wins.</p>
				<p class="justify last">Kaiya is super intelligent, with that ball drive that makes a dog so easy to train. She's pleasent, easy to live with, and just wants to please and protect her family.</p>

				<img src="images/riker/riker_head.jpg" class="w425 shadow" alt="Riker, German Shepherd, stacked">
				<h2><a href="riker.html" alt="Riker's page">Riker</a></h2>
				<p class="justify">Riker is a big bear of a Shepherd with a heart to match. This is the kind of Shepherd we looked far and wide for when we were doing our work with the Assistance Dogs. Soft body language, nice, even ball drive, sweet and affectionate, plus smart and trainable. He is the true: Calm, Trainable, Classic German Shepherd.</p>
				<p class="justify last">The very best of a German/American cross. Beautiful to look at, wonderful to live with, a joy to train.</p>
