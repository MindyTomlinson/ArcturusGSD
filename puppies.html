			<h1>Puppies</h1>
			<p>Our young guy Pirate is currently available. Unfortunately, he does not fit in with our breeding program and we've decided to make him available for the right companion home.</p>
			<p>A little bit about Pirate. He is a sweet-tempered gentle giant; he's good with kids, people, and other dogs. He is a very nicely bred dog with a good health background. He has been x-rayed and has OFA good hips and OFA normal elbows. Pirate has had basic obedience training, is crate-trained, rides nicely in a car, and is all-around a really fun dog. We will be sad to see him go, but we know he will make a wonderful companion for someone. He is not quite 2 years old. He is a big boy and I would imagine at maturity he will be 100 lbs. Asking $1000.</p>
			<p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
