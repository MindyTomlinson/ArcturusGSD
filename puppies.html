			<h1>Now Available!</h1>
			<p class="litter-desc justify">We have a puppy out of our Echo and Kiefernfel's Louis Vuiton Armist's litter whose new mom and dad were unfortunately unable to take him at this time. He's solid black and the biggest puppy in the litter. Very quiet and sweet-tempered, we believe he'd make a great family dog.</p>
			<p class="litter-desc">Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

				<h2><a href="kaiya.html">Kaiya</a></h2>
				<p class="justify">Kaiya is a Layla and Axle daughter. And just like her mother, Kaiya has quite a nose! She loves to show off her scenting ability with a game of "Find It", which she always wins.</p>
				<p class="justify last">Kaiya is super intelligent, with that ball drive that makes a dog so easy to train. She's pleasent, easy to live with, and just wants to please and protect her family.</p>

				<h2><a href="riker.html" alt="Riker's page">Riker</a></h2>
				<p class="justify">Riker is a big bear of a Shepherd with a heart to match. This is the kind of Shepherd we looked far and wide for when we were doing our work with the Assistance Dogs. Soft body language, nice, even ball drive, sweet and affectionate, plus smart and trainable. He is the true: Calm, Trainable, Classic German Shepherd.</p>
				<p class="justify last">The very best of a German/American cross. Beautiful to look at, wonderful to live with, a joy to train.</p>
