				<h1>Layla</h1>
				<h3 class="regName">Arcturus' One and Only</h3>
				<h3 class="pedigree">
						<span class="damsire">Dam:</span>Kaylee vom Arcturus<br>
						<span class="damsire">Sire:</span>Jolin's REO Speedwagon<br></h3>
				<p>Layla earned her name in an unusual way.  I was supposed to go to a Eric Clapton concert that night, but Kaylee had other plans!   Layla was the only girl born in a litter of 9 and of course, she had to be named after one of Eric Clapton's songs.</p>
				<p>She had to be tough to hold her own with 8 brothers,  but once she was out of the litter she became the sweetest little girl we could ask for.</p>
				<p>Layla has a strong ability to track, as did her Grandsire,  "Quando"  who is on our "About Us" page.  Quando sired several Police, and Search and Rescue dogs,  so  Layla is just following after her famous grandfather!</p>
				<p>Layla has been DNA-cleared of degenerative myelopathy (DM).</p>
